        <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
        Hi, I'm David - an aerospace engineer based in Los Angeles, California. 
        I work on satellites, where my day to day spans both model based systems engineering (MBSE), 
        and mission operations. I also have experience working on reliability, and
        frequently collaborate alongside fault management and ground software engineers. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
        I earned my B.S in aerospace engineering from UCLA in 2019, followed by an M.S from 
        the University of Michigan in 2021, with a focus on autonomous vehicles and optimization. For my masters 
        research, I worked on image processing and segmentation techniques applied to ultrasonic 
        C-scans of composite laminate panels for impact damage analysis - you can read that paper 
        <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2021-1510">here!</a>
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
        At UCLA I was very interested in space propulsion & systems engineering. 
        But by the end of my time at Michigan, my interests shifted toward AI and 
        machine learning, which became a major focus of my writing and exploration in 2021 and 2022.
        These days, my focus is increasingly on software and full-stack development. I believe there's 
        enormous potential to modernize how we approach space systems engineering by adopting a 
        programming mindset and building better software tools.

        <p class="text-h6 my-4">
        Some of my favorite books from recent years. Give them a read when you are able!
        </p>

          <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
            <b><i>The Outline Trilogy</i> by Rachel Cusk</b> - told mostly through a series of conversations, this trilogy explores identity, perception, and how we construct our lives with others. It's filled with poignant reflections â€” like the question of what to do when you're living a life shaped by an earlier version of yourself, but one you no longer feel connected to.
          </p> 
          <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
            <b><i>The Emporer of all Maladies</i> by Siddhartha Mukherjee</b> - an interesting look into the history of cancer. It showed me that cancer isn't just a biological puzzle; it's a societal one too, full of human stories, ethical dilemmas and shifting cultural values. I came away with an appreciation for how we, as a society approach complex scientific problems - not just with data, but often with political controversy, and always with compassion and creativy.  
          </p> 
          <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
            <b><i>Stay True</i> by Hua Tsu</b> - a quiet memoir on platonic friendship. One of my favorite definitions comes from this book: "A friend is someone who seeks to know, more than being known". It also resonated deeply as a reflection of what it's like to grow up Asian American on the West Coast - steeped in tech companies and Hollywood, in a place where being an immigrant is commonplace, but never quite seamless.
          </p> 
          <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
            <b><i>Pachinko</i> by Min Jin Lee</b> - a generational novel about a Korean family living as outsiders in Japan through the 20th century. Although there are a lot of themes in this book, what stood out to me was its exploration of how individuals navigate dignity, family, and ambition in a system that pressures people to blend in rather than stand out. It's a world where the reality of survival challenges our more noble ideals of virtue and ethics.
