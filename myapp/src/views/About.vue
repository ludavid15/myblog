        Hi, my name is David, I'm an aerospace engineer based in Los Angeles, California. 
        I work on satellites, mostly doing model based systems engineering (MBSE), 
        but lately I've shifted over to mission operations.

        <p class="text-h6 mb-4">
        I got my B.S from UCLA in 2019, and my M.S from 
        the University of Michigan in 2021. Both degrees were in aerospace engineering and 
        with a focus on autonomous vehicles and optimization. For my masters 
        program, I explored different image processing and segmentation 
        techniques on ultrasonic c-scans of composite laminate panels for 
        impact damage analysis. You can check out that paper <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2021-1510">here!</a>

        While at UCLA I was very interested in space propulsion & systems 
        engineering, but towards the end of my time at Michigan, I became 
        interested in AI & machine learning, which is mostly what I wrote 
        about in 2021 and 2022. These days, I'm thinking mostly about software, 
        and full-stack applications. I think there's a lot of opportunity to modernize
        how we approach space systems engineering by adopting a programming
        mindset and more software tools.
