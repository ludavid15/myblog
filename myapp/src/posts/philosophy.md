This is a bit of a wide net to cast, because philosophy comes in so many different forms. There's the usual suspects, like Nietzsche and his existentialism, but there are also more fundamental questions, like what does it mean to think? And what are the limitations of language? What is truth? What even is an idea? All very interesting questions to ponder and keep you up at night. There are also a few people on here I talk about, who I'm not sure necessarily count as philosophers. These are social scientists, and their theories on society, the economy, and politics. 

Finally, I just want to note that these are not my opinions. Nor does the inclusion of anyone's ideas here imply that I endorse their perspectives. 

# Part 1 - Fundamental Questions

<v-divider></v-divider>

## What does it mean to know?

In other words, what are the rules of philosophy? Do we think about questions logically? Or is logic and truth not the right way to think about such issues? Maybe we need to feel philosophy. Or maybe language itself is inherently meaningless, and doesn’t contain any truth. This field is officially referred to as *epistemology* or the study of knowledge. It is concerned with understanding things like truth, justification, and belief. 

## Jacques Derrida - Deconstruction 

A small piece that I understand of deconstruction poses this: that language is inherently fluid, and ideas exist in opposition to each other. And this tension between opposing ideas is itself the truth, or at least the end goal. To some extent, paradox and contradiction are the only consistent solutions. 



# Part 2 - The Meaning of Life (Ethics)

<v-divider></v-divider>

*Why are we here? What is the goal of life?*

## Soren Kierkegaard - Absurdism & Faith

The idea that life is inherently absurd and not able to be understood. Instead, a “leap of faith” is just about the only thing we can do. Kierkegaard also wrote a lot about "subjectivity". To him, every person's truth was subjective and unique to them. Faith was also very important to Kierkegaard, and he emphasized the importance of a strong, personal relationship with God, rather than something that can be institutionalized through the Church. 

## Friedrich Nietzsche - The Death of God & Existentialism 

Like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche believed that life is absurd. But whereas Kierkegaard saw God as the only thing to rely on, Nietzsche went in the opposite direction and turned inward. Instead, people must create their own meaning & ambition. This leads to the concept of "will to power", which Nietzsche argues is the driving force for human beings. It is the will to grow, create, and "assert" one's influence over the world. 

Nietzsche was also highly critical of traditional morality, which he said promoted weak values like humility and self-denial. As he argued, these values prevent a person from becoming the true version of themselves, which he envisioned as something called the Ubermensch, or "Overman". This Overman represents the ideal of human potential - an individual that has overcome themselves to embrace individuality, creativity, and who has the courage to live their life fully. 

Nietzsche also touched upon the concept of suffering. While many nihilists and existentialists of the time believed in the inherent suffering of existence, Nietzsche suggested that people lean into it. As he describes, suffering itself is not the problem, but rather it is the meaninglessness of it. Instead, suffering should be leveraged in the pursuit of growth and self-overcoming. 


## Jean Paul Sartre - Freedom through Absurdity 

Although existence is absurd, absurdity is freedom. This means we all as people enjoy the ultimate freedom of existence to do what we want. But money prevents people from experiencing true freedom (this gets a little into part 4). Sartre uses this existentialist perspective to argue against capitalism, unlike economists who provide a more “material quality of life for all” argument against capitalism.

* *Consider this example: what's stopping you right now from quitting your job to become a sheep farmer in New Zealand? We really are free, but choose not to exercise that right to its full extent due to social and economic factors.*



# Part 3 - How to Live Life

<v-divider></v-divider>

*What is the nature of our society, politics, and economy, and their impact on how we live?*

## Lao Tzu - Wu Wei

Or the idea of effortless action. That at the end of the day we are a part of nature, and it’s pointless to fight it. A common example cited is that of a farmer growing crops. No matter how much water, fertilizer, and sunlight he provides, he still can't force his crops to grow faster than normal. They are bounded by biology. Though this might seem like a negative, there's a positive side to this as well, which is that there exists a natural order and flow to things. Things do still happen, just maybe not in the direction you intend. 

Lao Tzu encourages us to align our direction with the natural order, and in doing so, we are carried forward anyway. Rather than paddle your way against the current, find a river going in the direction you want and allow yourself to be carried. 

In a way this is opposite of Nietzsche’s philosophy of individual ability, and brings in a bit of pre-determinism. Perhaps freedom is an illusion, and all that there ever is or will be is nature, and the pre-determinism of fate. But be careful, because the perspective of freedom as an illusion may lead to a lack of motivation or drive. 


# Part 4 - Social Economic Political Systems

<v-divider></v-divider>

## Michel Foucault - Madness of Society 

A big piece of Foucault’s philosophy is that there is a lot to learn from history, and that in fact many of today’s dominant attitudes and systems are inherently worse, often due to their sinister assumptions or undertones. For instance, crime and punishment today may appear more mundane, but that appearance of a “more fair” system legitimizes an inherently systematically biased system in favor of the dominant socio-economic group. 

## John Maynard Keynes - Government Intervention to save a Free Market 

Keynes argued that besides supply, a lack of demand contributes to economic recession. And demand is subject to uncertainty and psychological factors. Thus it's important for government to intervene in order to stabilize demand through economic downturns. Common criticisms are that overuse of government intervention can cause inflationary pressure and disincentivize work. 

## Friedrich Hayek - The Inevitable Tyranny of Government Oversight 

Hayek believed in an idea called "spontaneous order". The idea that the aggregate actions of individuals would lead to natural (though unpredictable) order. To this point, he believed that no central planning could ever capture all the factors and information required to find the most optical solution, and thus argued against government intervention in the economy. 
* *Example: ants don't plan their paths, but through the aggregate actions of the colony manage to find the shortest route.*

## Karl Marx - Class Conflict 

Karl Marx argued that society, politics, and the economy are fundamentally shaped by class conflict, driven by the struggle between those who own the means of production (the bourgeoisie) and those who labor for them (the proletariat). He believed that economic systems, particularly capitalism, create inherent inequalities and exploitation, as the ruling class uses power to maintain its dominance. This exploitation leads to alienation, where workers are disconnected from the products of their labor, their own humanity, and each other. Marx envisioned a future where these conflicts could be resolved through collective action, leading to a classless, communist society that eliminates exploitation and promotes shared prosperity.
