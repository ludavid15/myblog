Every year, instead of setting a specific new year's resolution, I pick a theme. These themes are usually one word values that I try to embody and learn about over the course of the year. For 2024, the theme was discipline. I selected this because I had been feeling distracted in 2023, and that I was procrastinating too often on things I should do. So, I endeavored to fix this in 2024. Discipline also fit well with the theme from 2023, which had been courage. I figured these two work hand in hand to help you make things happen, and to do all the things that align with your longterm goals. Whereas courage was useful for making big decisions, discipline could help with the small ones we make everyday. 

# Defining Discipline

<v-divider></v-divider>

One common conception of discipline is that it is the ability to stop yourself from doing something. This is ok and has it's uses, but I think this misses the broader point & can be ineffective. It's not enough to halt an activity (like doom scrolling), you have to replace it with something else. The key here is that discipline is a decision. It's not self-denial, it's a decision to do the other thing. 

That "other thing" really can be anything, as long as it is one of your goals. They can be serious goals, like losing weight, advancing in your career, or learning a new language. Or they can be casual goals like finishing all three Lord of the Rings extended cut movies in a single sitting. It's all still discipline, but we'll leave goal-setting as a discussion for another post.

# Tips & Tricks

We've defined what discipline is, but here are some practical tips for putting it into practice. 

## Be Specific and Have a Plan

Discipline is easier when you have a plan. If you goal is to "go the gym", set a time and day for when this is going to happen. Then when the time comes, the only decision you have to make is whether to go or not. 

## Be Prepared

Another way to make "discipline" easier is to know yourself and prepare ahead of time. For example, if your goal is to wake up at 7AM everyday, but you know you usually need 8 hours of sleep, make sure you go to bed by 11PM. If you're goal is to cook more, make sure you buy groceries and ingredients. The actual decision to work towards your objective does not stand alone - it exists in the context of all the small decisions you've already made. Make sure you keep organized and think things through. 

## Understand Yourself

Although discipline is often framed as self-denial of short-term gratification, it doesn't necessarily mean you can't practice self-compassion. In fact, quite the opposite: you should know your weaknesses and your motivators. Working towards your long term objectives shouldn't make you suffer, so if it does, figure out why you feel the way you do. 

For example, maybe you get frustrated by failure, and you aren't seeing immediate progress. This is perfectly normal, but it probably means you are focused too much on the long-term objective, and aren't setting your sights closer. If your goal is to lose 20 pounds, your objective for the day isn't to lose 20 lbs, it's to run for 30 minutes. 

In addition to the things that push you away from discipline, you should also know the things that pull you too. In other words, what causes you to procrastinate, and what draws your attention instead? Maybe it's video games or doom scrolling. If so, you should try to understand why they appeal to you, and try to mitigate these distractions before they arise. 

## Compounding Discipline

Discipline takes time to develop, but it also builds momentum, like compound interest. The more routine you already have, the easier it will be to add something new. It's like maintaining a clean vs messy room. If your room is already clean, it's easy to find a place for something new. Maybe you already even have an empty corner on your bookshelf for whatever new thing you've acquired. But if your room is messy, it's much more difficult to find a spot for anything new. Eventually it just gets lost within everything else that's going on. It takes time to sort and organize your life, but everytime you put something away, it clears up some room and makes the next thing a little easier. 


# Looking Ahead at 2025

We've framed discipline as the ability to guide yourself towards your long-term objectives. This of course means that discipline requires an objective in order to be useful. In other words, you canâ€™t be disciplined and also aimless. But how do we choose goals and what to work towards? How do we figure out what we want? I'll answer this question in 2025 with the theme "Be Intentional".
